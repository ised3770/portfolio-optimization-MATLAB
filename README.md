# Portfolio Optimisation using the Markowitz framework

The rates of returns are often not known in advance. We assume in the Markowitz framework that we possess estimates of their expected values. These estimates can be obtained by analysis of previous performance of the assets. We will consider a portfolio of five assets with yearly expected rates of returns and covariances according to Table 1.
